## SHIPPING RULES - READ FIRST

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: Perfectionism kills side hustles. These rules are non-negotiable:

### Hard Limits
- **Max 7 days** from idea to first deployable version
- **Max 3 features** in V1 (core functionality only)
- **No custom design** in V1 (use Tailwind/Bootstrap/existing templates)
- **No optimization** until you have 10 paying users
- **No refactoring** until something actually breaks

### The "Good Enough" Checklist
V1 ships when it has:
- [ ] Core feature works (solves the main problem)
- [ ] User can sign up/log in (can be basic auth)
- [ ] User can pay you (even if manual invoice)
- [ ] Hosted somewhere (doesn't have to be perfect)

### Banned Until V2
- Custom authentication systems (use Supabase/Firebase/Auth0)
- Building your own payment system (use Stripe/PayPal)
- Perfect responsive design (desktop-first, mobile "works")
- Animations and transitions
- Advanced error handling (basic try/catch is fine)
- Writing tests (add after you have revenue)
- SEO optimization
- Performance optimization
- Custom email templates (plain text works)

### The Shipping Mantra
**"Ugly and shipped beats perfect and unfinished"**

If it works and solves the problem, SHIP IT. You can't get feedback on code that's sitting on your laptop.

## 1. Micro-SaaS for Niche Industries

**Problem**: Small industries have specific needs but can't afford custom development

**Examples**:
- Appointment scheduling for pet groomers/tattoo artists (underserved vs generic tools)
- Inventory management for specialty retailers (comic shops, plant nurseries)
- Quote/invoice tools for specific trades (landscapers, contractors)

**Why it works**:
- Small niches = less competition
- Customers willing to pay $20-50/mo
- Focused features beat generic solutions

**Monetization**: Monthly SaaS, $500-2k MRR achievable

---

## 2. Automation Services for Local Businesses

**Problem**: Small businesses do repetitive manual work (data entry, reporting, scheduling)

**What you do**: Build custom automation tools on contract

**Why it works**:
- One-off projects
- Direct sales
- Immediate ROI for client

**Monetization**: $2k-10k per project, potential retainer deals

---

## 3. Browser Extensions for Specific Workflows

**Problem**: People waste time on repetitive web tasks

**Examples**:
- LinkedIn/job application auto-fillers
- Price tracking for specific product categories
- Data scrapers for research/comparison

**Why it works**:
- Low development overhead
- Direct value proposition
- Easy distribution via Chrome Web Store

**Monetization**: Freemium model ($5-15/mo premium)

---

## 4. API Wrappers & Integration Tools

**Problem**: Companies struggle to integrate APIs (Stripe, Shopify, etc.)

**What you do**: Pre-built integrations or middleware services

**Why it works**:
- Businesses need integrations but lack technical resources
- Ongoing value as APIs update
- Scalable solution

**Monetization**: Per-transaction fees or monthly tiers

---

## 5. No-Code Tool Alternatives

**Problem**: Zapier/Airtable are powerful but generic

**Opportunity**: Build focused alternatives for specific workflows

**Example**: "Email to CRM sync for real estate agents" instead of generic Zapier

**Why it works**:
- Better UX for specific use case
- Can undercut generic tools on price
- Easier onboarding for non-technical users

**Monetization**: Monthly subscriptions, typically cheaper than generic alternatives

## Where to Find Problems

1. **Reddit**:
   - r/Entrepreneur
   - r/smallbusiness
   - Industry-specific subreddits
   - Look for recurring complaints

2. **Twitter/X**:
   - Follow founders in specific niches
   - Watch for pain points and requests

3. **Your Network**:
   - Ask friends/family what manual work they hate
   - Interview people in industries you know

4. **Freelance Platforms**:
   - Upwork/Fiverr shows what people are willing to pay for
   - Recurring requests = market validation

---

## Recommended Path to First Dollar

1. **Pick a niche you understand** (hobby, previous job, friend's industry)
2. **Build a simple automation tool** for a specific pain point
3. **Sell it directly** to 5-10 businesses at $50-200/mo
4. **Iterate based on feedback**
5. **Scale or pivot** based on what works

## Concrete Opportunity Example

**Form-to-Database Automation Tool**

**Problem**: Many small businesses struggle with converting form submissions into organized databases/spreadsheets

**Solution**: A tool that:
- Auto-processes contact forms
- Validates data
- Syncs to their CRM or Google Sheets
- Sends notifications

**Pricing**: $30-50/mo per business

**Target Market**:
- Service businesses (plumbers, electricians, consultants)
- Small e-commerce shops
- Local professionals

**Why it works**:
- Solves immediate pain
- Clear ROI (saves hours per week)
- Easy to demonstrate value

## Success Factors

**What Makes These Projects Successful:**
- Clear requirements and well-defined scope
- Use established frameworks/patterns
- Solve real problems (even if small)
- Focus on functionality over novel architecture

**Less Successful (Currently):**
- Highly novel/unique architectures
- Complex state management without clear specs
- Projects requiring deep domain expertise
- Large-scale refactoring of legacy systems

## Next Steps

1. Review this list and identify 2-3 opportunities that align with your interests/network
2. Research the niche (Reddit, forums, talk to potential customers)
3. Build a simple MVP (aim for 1-2 weeks with AI assistance)
4. Get 5 potential customers to test it
5. Iterate and improve based on feedback
6. Launch and start selling
